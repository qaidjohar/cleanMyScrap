This script accepts a source directory from the user. It scans the last modified time of the directory and files in the entered directory.

It accepts an integer threshold value from the user. Using this threshold value, files in the source directory are moved to a Temp directory which is created in that source directory.

For Example: If user enteres threshold value 3, then the files or directories not modified from last 3 days will be moved to the Temp directory.
